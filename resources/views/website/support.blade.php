TagiMagi.com is a personal website by Marcus Wilson. 
You can support this website/movement and help it grow to maturity by donating directly to Marcus Wilson 
or by purchasing/viewing any of Marcus' books/music <a href=http://the5thhuman.wordpress.com/about>here</a>. Marcus is an author, creator, as well as many other things. 
TagiMagi.com is currently at around 1/7 of its  phase, but to 'keep the lights on' and to continue to add necessary features,  
your support in any way will help it grow.  If you would like to join Marcus in creating next level internet, 
by volunteering as a programmer or any other universally beneficial ideas you have, you can also contact 
at any of the social networks in the links (vimeo is preferred). In the meantime, the best way to help is to help yourself 
and use the site!  It's 100% free, it's by all, for all, and its goal is to help everyone more easily achieve what they need and prefer.
